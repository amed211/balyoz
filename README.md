# BALYOZ ( sledgehammer )
This repository is coded to teach a lesson to dictators and their supporters who usurp the will of the people and is used with devastating DDoS attacks, but it is useless when used alone, it must be used with a large group or integrated into botnets. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ALONE, UNITED WE WILL BE STRONG

# Usage
The sledgehammer program is designed to be compatible with Windows devices, and to adapt it to Linux, change the code on line 91 to the following code: "tcph->flags = TH_SYN;"

Since the program uses raw socket, you need to run the program with administrator privileges.

It sends over 100 SYN packets in 1 second, just enter the IP address and port number, the program does the rest.
