# BALYOZ ( sledgehammer )
This repository is coded to teach a lesson to dictators and their supporters who usurp the will of the people and is used with devastating DDoS attacks, but it is useless when used alone, it must be used with a large group or integrated into botnets. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ALONE, UNITED WE WILL BE STRONG

# Usage
The sledgehammer program is designed to be compatible with Windows devices, and to adapt it to Linux, change the code on line 91 to the following code: "tcph->flags = TH_SYN;"

Since the program uses raw socket, you need to run the program with administrator privileges.

It sends over 100 SYN packets in 1 second, just enter the IP address and port number, the program does the rest.

The Balyoz program is coded 100% in C++, because C++ is the programming language with the highest performance and what Python can do in 10 hours, C++ can do in 10 minutes, so the most suitable language for coding DDoS programs is C++.

# Attention important note If used incorrectly, you may cut off your own internet connection.
The sledgehammer software is a very powerful and destructive software, it sends around 30,000 syn packets per second. If your internet does not have a wide bandwidth to handle 30,000 packets per second, there will be a blockage in your internet bandwidth as soon as you start the attack and your internet will be cut off. Therefore, use the sledgehammer software on internet networks with wide bandwidth.
